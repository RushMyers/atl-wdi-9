# CoffeeMaker

# Write a CoffeeMaker class with a water_level and a coffee cartridge.

# The CoffeeMaker class should have the following:

# instance vars: water_level, cartridge (use attr_reader for these)
# methods: add_water(amount), add_cartridge(flavor), brew
# a to_s method that prints the water level and the cartridge flavor
# Note that the brew method should check for sufficient water and that a cartridge is loaded. Calling brew should result in one of the following messages to be printed:

# Cannot brew, please add water.
# Cannot brew, please add cartridge.
# Started brewing your Dark Roast!
# The water level is a range from 0 to 100 (percent)
# The water level must be at least 25 to brew a cup of coffee
# Each brew should discard the cartridge and lower the water level by 25
# Test your code by:
# creating a CoffeeMaker
# try to brew (no water or coffee)
# add water
# try to brew (no coffee)
# add cartridge("Dark Roast")
# try to brew (should be successful this time)

class CoffeeMaker
  attr_reader :water_level, :cartridge
  attr_writer :water_level, :cartridge

  def initialize(water_level, cartridge)
    @water_level = water_level,
    @cartridge = cartridge

    def add_water(amount)
      @water_level += amount
    end


  end
